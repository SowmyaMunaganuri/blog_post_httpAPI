I have developed REST API /api/posts in file 'api.js'
Main server file is 'server.js' 
So "npm run server" should be used to start running our application on 5000 port

data.js is my test json file used for testing.

function get(https) in api.js is the base function to fetch data from provided URL
i.e  https://hatchways.io/api/assessment/blog/posts

ROUTE1: api/ping ==>  with success true 

ROUTE2: api/posts ==> with all logical operations on extracted json file are implemented. 

localhost:5000/api/posts?tags=science&sortBy=authorId&direction=desc 
is example solution of my implementation.
